My personal CSS styleguide



General
-------

- Always put a space between a selector and its opening curly brace.
- Properties should be indented four spaces.
- Soft tabs that span four spaces must be used.
- Put a space after the colon before values.
- Try to not be overly specific.

        .selector{
            property: value;
        }
